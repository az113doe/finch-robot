Finch robot to move around with user input

## Approach:
- Usage of Scanner to detect user input
- Conditional Statements (WASD) for the movement
- W - Forward
- S - Backward
- A - Turn Left
- D - Turn Right
- Calling the setMove and setTurn methods from finch.java class

## End Result:
The end result should be moving forward and backward. However, the end result I want would be for A and D, to turn the robot and have it also move
